IAH: INTERNET WAR is a Turn-based strategy that meets real-time battles. Explore the internet, fight enemies, and create bots. Play your way with a cursor, controller, or code.

This repository contains the starter C# code to help you start writing your own IAH AI Code in C#. This is quite WIP and will be ready in about one week.
